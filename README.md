# Weather-Tracker

## A place to view the daily and 5 day weather forecast!

## [Weather Tracker] (https://ajmanzione.github.io/Weather-Tracker/)



- The motivation for this project was to generate a weather tracking app that allows the user to input any city of their choice and to generate the current weather and a 5 day forecast of the weather. When the user inputs a city, it automatically generates a history tab where the user can select that city again and again
- I built this project to solve the challenges of a user needing to re-type cities that they have already entered. The app generates temperatures and windpeeds on the imperial system meaning tempurature is displayed in Farenheit anf wind speed in MPH
- The application build was very challenging and tested my abilities to use server-side API's and local storage.

## And when the user enters a City name

- search history automatically generated button's appear
