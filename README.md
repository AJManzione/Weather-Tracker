## [Weather Tracker] (https://ajmanzione.github.io/Timed-Quiz/)

## Randomly generates a password depending on what options you choose!


- The motivation for this project was to create a timed quiz that tests my coding ability in many ways. The first way it tests my ability is the displaying and hiding content on the screen. Part if what makes Javascript so useful is the abilty to create a website thats dynamic and I believe this project allowed me to display those skills.
- I built the project to have many dynamic elements such as a timer, that decrements if the user answers the question wrong, and does not if they answer the question right. There are five questions and the user will see their scores at the end of the quiz and even has the chance to save their initials.
- The application allowed me to test many skills at once and was a complete blast to work on!
